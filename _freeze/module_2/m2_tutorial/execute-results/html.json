Click on the button to download the archive. Save it on your computer (in your *Downloads* folder for example). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<a href=\"https://github.com/epicentre-msf/obt-training/raw/master/tutorials_materials/module_2.zip\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-default\"><i class=\"fa fa-save\"></i> Download materials</button>\n</a>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. Unzip the whole archive and save the files locally. It is better to save the unzipped folder in a location that is not actively synchronised with OneDrive at the moment.\n:::\n\n\n### Description of the folder content\n\n- a (simplified) **setup file** for a measles OBT linelist \n- an empty linelist generated by that dictionary to better help you see how the specs translate into the final product)\n- the most recent **designer file**\n\n\n## Part 0: unlock files and functionalities {#sec-unblock-file}\n\nOBT linelists use VBA macros to add functionalities. As a consequence, linelists that come from the internet often need to be unblocked, and macro enabled in them. \n\n::: {.instructions}\nUnblock your files, or make sure they are already unlocked. If you have never done that before, [follow the steps from this page](../how_to/unblock_files.qmd)\n:::\n\n\n## Part 1: Generate a linelist from an existing setup\n\n\n\n## Part 2: Add columns to a linelist\n\n### Continuous\n\n### Categorical\n\n\n## Part 3: Add analyses\n\n## Part 4: Add an MoH export",
