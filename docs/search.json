    "text": "Linelist\n\n\n\nOutbreakTools menu in OBT linelists\n\n\n\nData table\n\n\n\nButtons acting on data tables\n\n\n\nShow / Hide variables\nClicking on the “Show/hide variables” button opens a window listing all the variables in this linelist sheet.\n\n\n\nShow hide button and pop-up window\n\n\nVariable can have three visibility status:\n\nMandatory: variables cannot be hidden with the Show/Hide\nShown: variables are currently visible but can be hidden by ticking “Hide” on the right\nHide: variables are currently hidden but can be made visible by ticking “Show” on the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can hide all optional variables in one go by clicking on the “Hide all optional variables” button.1\nThe button will change to “Show all optional variables”, to allow the reverse action.\n\n\n1 If the linelist has a lot of optional variables shown by default and you wish to make a very minimal linelist, this might be faster than hiding most variables one by one: just unhide the variables that you need if any\n\nAdd rows\nBy default, the linelist has 200 empty lines. But you can add more when these are filled. Click on the “Add Rows” button to add 200 new empty rows.\n\n\nResize table\nYou can resize the table to remove empty rows at the bottom of the table on the linelist sheet. Click on the “Resize table” button to remove any empty row.\n\n\nClear all filters\nTo remove all the filters at once, click on the “Clear all filters” button. This is useful if you applied filters to several columns scattered left and right of the table and want to reverse to the full view without missing a sneaky filter somewhere.\n\n\nSort the variable\nIf you need to visualize your data by sorting on specific variables (date of notification for example), you need to use the sorting function. Place the cursor in a cell of the column you want to sort (from line 9) and click on the button.\nThe first time you click, you have a message to confirm the action, once you click yes, you cannot undo it. The first time it sorts by ascending order, if you click again, it will sort by descending order.\n\n\nWeek start\nChose the day that starts the week in your country using the “Week start” button. The selected value will be applied to the whole linelist (calculated epiweeks, as well as in the analyses).\nWhen you click on the button, a pop up window appears, where you can select the day of the week. Then close the window.\n\n\nAutofit columns\nUse this button to improve column width so that the columns take less space. The fit takes into account the label, the length of categories of the variable (if any) and the name of the variable (hidden).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can manually modify the width of columns in the linelist table to adjust to content the way you would do in any Excel file.\n\n\n\n\nGeoHelper\nThe GeoHelper is a popup window that helps you entering geographic data surch as the origin of the patient or the name of the facility (if the “hf” control was used for the variable). It is mostly used to enter data on the patient data sheet, but it is also useful on the Spatio-Temporal analysis sheet.\nTo use it, place your cursor in a “geo” or “hf” column (you can recognise them thanks to the orange headers), in the admin 1 level. Click on the “Geohelper” button, or hit the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + G. It opens a window, with several tabs, depending on whether you are in a “geo” (described by four visible columns) or in “hf” (decribed by one isible column).\nIf you are in a “geo” section, you will have three tabs that you can use to select administrative levels.\n\nCascade: select the admin levels with cascading menus, by selecting one admin level after the other, starting from the highest one.\nSearch: search by typing the name (needs at least 3 letters)\nHistory: quickly find a previous entry entered through the GeoHelper (does not work for data entered using the regular cascading dropdowns).\n\nOnce the location has been found, select it and click on “OK”.\n\n\n\nRefresh analyses\n\n\n\nRefresh analyses button\n\n\nHit the “Refresh analyses” button to update analyses on all analyses sheets in one go. You should use it whenever you entered new data or when you applied filters to existing data and want to see the analyses on this subset of data.2\n2 Do not forget to remove the filters and refresh the analyses at the end to not be confused but the numbers in a couple of days\n\nImports\n\n\n\nImports section\n\n\n\nImport data\nThe « Import Data » button allows you to import data in the linelist. This data must be in a special format typically produced by exporting data from another OutbreakTools linelist for the same disease.\nFirst a window opens to select the file to import. Select it and click on “OK”. At the end, a message will inform you of the success and provide a little import report is you wish so. Inspect it to see if there are any unexpected discrepancies (loosing variables should always be investigated!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe same button is used whether the data is partial (generated by the regular export button, anonymised or not, with metadata or not), or extensive (generated through the “Export for migration” button, from the Advanced section of the ribbon).\n\n\nIf there is already data in the file, a message will inform you of that fact and ask you what you wish to do. It is possible to append the new data at the bottom of the already present data. This is a handy way to create temporary master linelists, or to gather data entered by two data-encoders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure the data is not overlapping before importing, as the import will just paste the data at the bottom of the existing data, and you would end up with duplicates to clean.\n\n\n\n\nImport geobase\n“Import geobase” allows you to import a geobase in the linelist. If the current linelist had already a geobase, it will be replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe import of the geobase does not affect the data already entered in the linelist, it only fills the modalities offered by dropdown menus. If data is already present in the linelist and the new geobase has different levels, you need to correct them yourselves.\n\n\nGo here to learn how to download a geobase.\n\n\n\nExports\nThe regular exports buttons are available in the “Export section” of the ribbon, and the “Export for migration” is available in the Advanced section of the ribbon.\n\n\n\nExports section\n\n\n\nExport data\nOutbreakTools linelists have the feature to export data in a separated excel file, to share with partners or perform more advance analyses. The characteristics of the exports (which variables, anonymisation or not, password protected or not etc.) are pre-defined in the setup file that is used to generate the linelist.\nWhile Epicentre linelists should have at minima be an “Anonymous export for MSF” button, the other available exports differ between linelists created.\nTo export data, click on the “Export Data” button, which opens a popup window, with several options. At the top, you will see buttons for different exports. After clicking on the desired export, a window pops-up for saving the export. If “Export Filtered Data” is selected, a confirmation message will pop-up first to ask you whether this is what you really want.\nOnce the folder has been selected and after clicking “OK”, a new window opens to confirm the export and, if the export is protected, provide the associated password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you forgot the password, click on the “Export Button” again, and then click on the “Show actual private key” to display the password again.\n\n\nClick on the button “Generate new password” to change the password used by default.\n\n\nExport analyses\nYou can export all the tables from the analysis sheets in one document by using the “Export the analysis sheets” button and selecting the directory where you want to save them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf the analysis are made on filtered data, the tables will be exported as such.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister and Case report form\nYou can print a register directly based on the linelist.\n\n\n\nRegister and case report form section\n\n\nThe features from this category only work if you are on a data entry sheet, otherwise you get an error message.\nClick on “Show register”; it opens a new sheet that contains all the variables from the linelist. On this sheet, you can use the Data Table features can be used just as in the original linelist sheet:\n\n“Add rows” and “Resize table” work exactly the same (except that it adds 10 rows at once)\n“Show/Hide variables” works the same but looks a bit different. Instead of “Show” you can select “print” and the orientation of the header. You can also import the parametrisation of hidden/shown columns from the regular linelist table, or change column width.\n\nYou can rotate all the labels at once by clicking the “Rotate headers” button. You can define the heigh of the row by clicking directly on “Row height”, a pop-up opens where you can define the heigh.\nAll labels are editable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou should hide all calculted variable, they have no place i a register book\n\n\nOnce customized, you can close the sheet by clicking the red cross, all your modifications are saved.\nOnce ready, you can use the “Print” button to open the print preview view (whether you are on the register sheet or the linelist sheet). All the variables to be printed fit one page (landscape). If you are satisfied, you can print.\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\n\nAdvanced button and pop-up window\n\n\n\nExport for migration\nThis button exports raw data and metadata for migration to another linelist file.3\n3 Whether that is to upgrade versions, move out of a corrupt file or create a temporary master-linelistYou can choose to export the patient data, the geobase and the history of the geobase (history list in the GeoHelper), by ticking the matching cases. There are also options to include metadata on the state of hidden/shown columns (to not have to redo the full setup in the new file), and the updated labels of the custom variables, if you used these variables.\n\n\n\nExport for migration\n\n\nAfter selecting the options and clicking on “Export”, a window pops-up for saving the export. Select the folder and click on “OK”. Once finished a message appears to ask if you want to close the window.\nThe export creates three files:\n\na file containing the data and all sort of metadata\na file containing the geobase that is currently in the linelist, as well as the history from the GeoHelper\na file containing only the GeoHelper history (in case you want to upgrade to a new version of the geobase but wished to keep your GeoHelper history)\n\n\n\nImport geobase history\nThis button allows you to import a file containing the history of the geobase (such a file was created by exporting the data from migration, see above).\n\n\nLast Import Report\nThe button allows you to display the report from the last import made.\n\n\nDelete data or geobase history\nThis are a dangerous buttons that allows you to delete data or geobase history from the linelist.\n“Delete all data” allows you to remove all the data you entered from the workbook. After clicking, you will have a warning message. To confirm the deletion, you will need to enter the full name of the file.\n“Delete geobase history” allows you to empty the table with the geobase history so the list of suggestion of the history method from the GeoHelper will be empty.\n\n\nRestore the state of hidden columns\nThis button allows you to restore the state of hidden columns (i.e. hide them all again) if, for any reasons these columns had been shown.\nNote that hidden columns are not supposed to be shown, and the user can thus not modify their visibility state from the regular Show/Hide variables button, hence this button."

    "text": "Too Long; Did Not Read\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many excel linelists around, a lot of them are bad and generate data of terrible quality. The good ones are all different, and it is still often hard to gather data from different places. OubreakTools aims at providing robust, standardised linelists, with a system to send, centralise and visualise data.\n\n\n\nIn order to run its projects, MSF and other organisation rely on patient level data during outbreak response. It is often recorded in several files (register, patient file, case investigation form, etc.) but some of it is usually gathered in so-called linelists files. These files are used by epidemiologists to describe outbreaks, but also by the medical team and HQ to monitor activities at a local or higher level. Good quality patient data can be further analysed to provide additional information such as risk factors, or pluged in models for forecasting.\nLinelists are, in essence, flat tables where one line represent one patient, and one column represents one variable for this patient. As such, linelists can be created in many software. Excel, while not the only available tool, has been massively used to collect linelist data across the world.\n\n\n\nIt is easy to create a table in Excel to collect data: most people can do it\nIt is easy to further customise (adding variables, changing labels etc.), making the file adaptable\nIt is easy to deploy because everybody knows a bit of Excel, minimal training is necessary\nYou can have some descriptive analyses within the file, which helps user have direct information on site\nExcel is accessible offline, which is practical in places where internet access is limited\nYou can share the file with partners such as the MoH if needed\n\nIn short, pretty much everybody can make a linelist if they need to, and many people do.\n\n\n\nOf course, Excel linelists have their drawbacks too:\n\nDeveloping a good linelist that fosters data quality takes much more time than just setting up a table, and not everybody knows the Excel functionalities to do so. The consequence of that is that there are a lot of terrible linelists around\nFiles for different diseases usually differ a lot. They may have been developped by different people with different skills. Perhaps the developper used a common template at the start and re-used code, but usually the file diverge. Bringing the same functionalities to all of them takes time and effort\nConsequently, maintenance of the files is time consuming. Using VBA scripts to easily get data in and out of your linelist helps, but does not solve all the problem.\nThe files can get heavy and finicky when they get too complicated\nData protection is not as good as dedicated clinical software such as RedCap\nExcel files are not centralised by default: each site has its own data. Even if the linelist template is the same, it takes manual actions to gather the data and centralise it\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, there is a whole ecosystem of files used in and outside MSF, with different interfaces, dictionaries, functionalities, languages. The data is fragmented, hard to reconcile and often of bad quality. This makes it is hard to have visibility on MSF activities and to exploit the data.\nTo alleviate some of the above problems, MSF OCs try to provide linelists on which disease referent and epidemiologists agreed upon, to standardise data collection within OC.

    "text": "Too Long; Did Not Read\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many excel linelists around, a lot of them are bad and generate data of terrible quality. The good ones are all different, and it is still often hard to gather data from different places. OubreakTools aims at providing robust, standardised linelists, with a system to send, centralise and visualise data.\n\n\n\nIn order to run its projects, MSF and other organisation rely on patient level data during outbreak response. It is often recorded in several files (register, patient file, case investigation form, etc.) but some of it is usually gathered in so-called linelists files. These files are used by epidemiologists to describe outbreaks, but also by the medical team and HQ to monitor activities at a local or higher level. Good quality patient data can be further analysed to provide additional information such as risk factors, or pluged in models for forecasting.\nLinelists are, in essence, flat tables where one line represent one patient, and one column represents one variable for this patient. As such, linelists can be created in many software. Excel, while not the only available tool, has been massively used to collect linelist data across the world.\n\n\n\nIt is easy to create a table in Excel to collect data: most people can do it\nIt is easy to further customise (adding variables, changing labels etc.), making the file adaptable\nIt is easy to deploy because everybody knows a bit of Excel, minimal training is necessary\nYou can have some descriptive analyses within the file, which helps user have direct information on site\nExcel is accessible offline, which is practical in places where internet access is limited\nYou can share the file with partners such as the MoH if needed\n\nIn short, pretty much everybody can make a linelist if they need to, and many people do.\n\n\n\nOf course, Excel linelists have their drawbacks too:\n\nDeveloping a good linelist that fosters data quality takes much more time than just setting up a table, and not everybody knows the Excel functionalities to do so. The consequence of that is that there are a lot of terrible linelists around\nFiles for different diseases usually differ a lot. They may have been developped by different people with different skills. Perhaps the developper used a common template at the start and re-used code, but usually the file diverge. Bringing the same functionalities to all of them takes time and effort\nConsequently, maintenance of the files is time consuming. Using VBA scripts to easily get data in and out of your linelist helps, but does not solve all the problem.\nThe files can get heavy and finicky when they get too complicated\nData protection is not as good as dedicated clinical software such as RedCap\nExcel files are not centralised by default: each site has its own data. Even if the linelist template is the same, it takes manual actions to gather the data and centralise it\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, there is a whole ecosystem of files used in and outside MSF, with different interfaces, dictionaries, functionalities, languages. The data is fragmented, hard to reconcile and often of bad quality. This makes it is hard to have visibility on MSF activities and to exploit the data.\nTo alleviate some of the above problems, MSF OCs try to provide linelists on which disease referent and epidemiologists agreed upon, to standardise data collection within OC. Some of these files are quite good, some of them not so much. The quality and functionalities included tend to depend on both OC and disease.\nBetter, for some diseases, OCs reached an agreement on a dictionary and a common tool. Epicentre has provided a number of these “intersection” linelists in the recent years. This files however also suffered from some problems: they were hard to maintain and had different functionalities depending on diseases .The number of functionalities, and the general data quality increased with time as skills grew, which resulted in very different linelist in terms of both interface and capacities\nEpicentre tried to go a step further, capitalising on what was learned developing and maintaining these tools, and developed OutbreakTools a set of tools to improve data collection, quality and visualisation.

    "text": "OutbreakTools\n\nConcept\nThe main idea of OutbreakTools linelist generation is to separate the content of the linelist (which variables and analyses are in the linelist) from the file interface and functionalities.1\n1 An idea that is not novel, as separating content and presentation (or style) is a classic idea, that you find in HTML/CSS, Markdown, Latex or even using styles in WordThe content is described in a setup file, a special Excel file that allows describing all the variables and the analyses that should go in the linelist. Another Excel file, the designer, reads the setup file and runs scripts to generate a linelist. The designer creates the whole linelist structure, adds the buttons and many functionalities.You can think of the setup file as a recipe for a given linelist.If you think of the setup file as a recipe, the designer is the food processor.\n\n\n\nCreating a linelist with Outbreaktools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee the Module 2 to learn how to modify a setup file and compile a linelist\n\n\nThe advantages of this approach are:\n\nSomeone with no knowledge of VBA can use the OBT to build or modify a linelist, as long as they know how to fill a setup file.\nThe maintenance of functionalities is done by a specialist in Epicentre, who generates new versions of the designer. Upon update of the designer, linelists can be regenerated in a couple of minutes to incorporate the updates.2\n\n2 Which is not an instantaneous process, but infinitely faster than manually porting code and fixes from one linelist to a different one with lots of code adaptation, and then migrating data more or less by hand depending on the linelist.\n\nOutbreakTools Workflow\nIn addition linelists development, OutbreakTools contains tools that rely on the standardised nature of the created linelists to build data cleaning workflow and dashboard much faster than ever before. When a new linelist is created, a simple functional dashboard can be build in a couple of days, with automatic data gathering from a mail address.\nThe full workflow allows epidemiologists or data teams to send their data to Epicentre for it to be displayed on a dashboard. The data will usually be displayed between one or two hours after being sent.\n\n\n\nThe linelist-to-dashboard workflow"

    "text": "OutbreakTools linelists\nThis section will describe linelist functionalities.\n\nA note on languages\nA given setup file can contain several languages, so as long as the translation for a language is provided, the designer can compile a linelist in this language. All the created linelists will thus have the same interface, variable names and functionalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause the translations of all labels and categories are available in the setup file, the compilation scripts can automatically translate the data received in different language to English, which allow to gather all the data in the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nA note on geographic data\nDescribing geographic data is a huge challenge for patient data (independently of the software used). The problem is usually that it is hard to access geographic levels to describe places in al the countries that we work in, these data may change overtime, is often incomplete, and sometimes several source of data contradict themselves.\nIn OBT linelists, as in many linelists developed before, we made the arbitrary choice to describe geographic locations with fours hierarchical administrative levels. So each location is associated with four columns with cascading dropdown menus (and several hidden calculated columns).\nThe categories with which to populate dropdown menus are country specific. A member of the EpiDS team is tasked to gather geographic data from different places (GIS unit, OCHA HDX, local GIS officers etc.) and create database of geographic locations associated with shapefiles (files to plot geographic data). As a part of OutbreakTools, we provide Excel tabulated versions of this data, the so-called geobases, which can be imported very easily in OBT linelists to fill the dropdown menus for locations. These geobases are accessible online in the Geoapp."
