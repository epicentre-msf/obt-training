    "text": "Presentation of OutbreakTools\n\nConcept\nThe main idea of OutbreakTools linelist generation is to separate the content of the linelist (which variables and analyses are in the linelist) from the file interface and functionalities.1\n1¬†An idea that is not novel, as separating content and presentation (or style) is a classic idea, that you find in HTML/CSS, Markdown, Latex or even Word styles.2¬†You can think of the setup file as a recipe for a given linelist.3¬†If you think of the setup file as a recipe, the designer is the food processor.The content is described in a setup file, a special Excel file that allows describing all the variables and the analyses that should go in the linelist.2 Another Excel file, the designer, reads the setup file and runs scripts to generate a linelist. The designer creates the whole linelist structure, adds the buttons and many functionalities.3\n\n\n\nCreating a linelist with Outbreaktools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe module 2 teaches you how to modify a setup file and compile a linelist\n\n\nThe advantages of this approach are:\n\nSomeone with no knowledge of VBA can use the OBT tools to build or modify a linelist, as long as they know how to fill a setup file.\nThe maintenance of functionalities is done by a specialist in Epicentre, who generates new versions of the designer. Upon update of the designer, linelists can be regenerated in a couple of minutes to incorporate the updates.4\n\n4¬†Which is not an instantaneous process, but infinitely faster than manually porting code and fixes from one linelist to a different one with lots of code adaptation, and then migrating data, with more or less hasle depending on the linelist.\n\nOutbreakTools Workflow\nIn addition to linelist development, OBT contains tools that rely on the standardised nature of the linelists to build data cleaning workflows and dashboards much faster than ever before. When a new linelist is created, a simple functional dashboard can be build in less than a couple of days, including automatic data gathering from a mail address and compilation.\nThe full workflow allows epidemiologists or data teams to send their data to Epicentre for it to be displayed on a dashboard. The data will usually be displayed between one or two hours after being sent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: The linelist-to-dashboard workflow"

    "text": "OutbreakTools linelists\nOBT linelist contain what you may have come to expect from mature linelists: places to enter data and metadata, a couple of analyses, and ways to deal with languages and places.\n\nInterface\nThey always have the same functionalities, which include:\n\nPossibility to upload pre-formatted geobases to standardise geographical information\nBasic analyses (uni and bivariate tables, epicurves, top x locations with the most cases etc.)\nData and analyses export (anonymous or not)\nPossibility to show or hide optional variables\nPossibility to migrate data to a newer version of the linelist\n‚Ä¶\n\nMost of the important features of the linelist can be accessed through the OutbreakTools Menu at the top of Excel interface.\nStructure of the file\nAt minima, an OutbreakTools linelist contains these sheets:\n\nAn Info sheet which contains metadata about the project\n\nAt least one data entry sheet to enter patient data\n\nSome or all of the following analyses sheets containing basic exploration of data:\n\nUni and bivariate analyses\nTemporal analyses (epicurves and their associated tables)\nSpatial analyses (top X locations of cases)\nSpatio-temporal analyses (epicurves for chosen locations)\n\nA Custom dropdown sheet where the user can define categories for some specific variables\nA Custom tables sheet where the user can create a pivot table of the data\nA Geo sheet showing the loaded geobase.\n\n\n\nLanguages\nOBT linelists usually exist in several languages. In that case there is one file per language (by opposition to a button to switch language within one linelist).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can enter several languages in a given setup file, and chose in the designer which of these languages to generate a linelist in. The generated files have the same interface and dictionary, and differ only in the interface and label languages (variable names are the same).\nBecause the translations of all labels and categories are available in the setup file, the compilation scripts can automatically translate the data received in different languages to English, to gather all the data in the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic data\nDescribing geographic data is a huge challenge for patient data (independently of the software used). It is generally hard to access geographic levels to describe places in all the countries that we work in: the data may change over time, is often incomplete, and sometimes several sources of data contradict each others.\nIn OBT linelists, as in many linelists developed before, we made the arbitrary choice to describe geographic locations with four hierarchical administrative levels. Each location is thus associated with four columns containing cascading dropdown menus (as well as several hidden derived columns).\nThe categories with which to populate dropdown menus are country specific. A member of the EpiDS team is tasked to gather geographic data from different places (GIS unit, OCHA HDX, local GIS officers etc.) and create database of geographic locations associated with shapefiles (files to plot geographic data). As a part of OutbreakTools, we provide Excel tabulated versions of this data, the so-called geobases, which can be imported very easily in OBT linelists to fill the dropdown menus for locations. These geobases are accessible online in the Geoapp."

    "section": "Part 2: linelist in use",
    "text": "Part 2: linelist in use\n\nüß≠ Context\nThe linelist was deployed in January 2022 in Moissala and the neighbouring areas. Almost a year later, in April 2023, the measles outbreak is still ongoing and the linelist still in use. You receive the file with data and you want to have a look at it.\nYou are now going to work on the file measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb, which contains simulated measles data6.\n6¬†The data used in this exercise was simulated using parameters from MSF measles data, at least for some major variables, which avoids the problem of working with personnam data\n\nSanity checks\nWhen you receive an unknown linelist with data, always perform a couple of checks to get a feel of the state of the file and data. These are not the extensive checks you would perform if you were tasked to monitor data entry and quality, or to perform analyses. They might however rapidly hint at the source of a reported problem (a functionality not working as expected).\n\nFile structure checks\nIs the file obviously damaged?\n\nDoes the OBT menu appears as expected (buttons have legible labels)?\nTest one button (for example, open the Show/Hide window): does it work as expected?\nDo you see the expected sheets?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf the ribbon buttons have weird labels or no labels at all, it means that the VBA is not activated or crashed. Check your VBA settings, close the file and re-open it.\nIf the problem persist, attempt an ‚ÄúExport for migration‚Äù to move the data to a new empty template.\nIf the export does not work because the VBA is corrupted, contact the EpiDS team to get help migrating the data.\n\n\n\nDo these checks on the file measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb.\n\n\n\n(Very basic) Data checks\n\nAre the metadata on the ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù sheet (still) correctly filled?7\nDo patients have IDs?\nAre there replicated IDs?\nCheck the filters of a couple of date columns: do the dates correspond to what you expect (min, max) and are there values not recognised as dates?\nCheck a couple of categorical columns (sex, outcome‚Ä¶) to see if the categories entered correspond to the expected values.\nRemove any filters applied on the data (there is a shortcut for that in the OBT menu).\n\n7¬†90% of export-dashboard problems come from badly filled metadata\nDo these checks on the file measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyses\nNow let‚Äôs investigate the descriptive analyses provided with the linelist. While the general interface of the linelist is the same, the provided analyses may differ from disease to disease, depending on what was requested.8 Most linelists have at least the uni and bivariate tables, the temporal and spatial analyses.\n8¬†Note that more analyses can be requested if needed.There are a couple of important things to remember about the analyses in OBT linelists:\n\nAnaslyses need to be refreshed before being explored.\n\n\n\n\nRefresh button in the OBT menu\n\n\n\nIf you filter data in the main patient sheet, it will be reflected in the analyses after you refresh (a red warning will appear to remind you).\nYou can alter the appearance of the graphs (which are created automatically and admittedly a bit ugly), the same way you would do for your own figures, with any Excel tool.9\n\n9¬†Note that graphs modifications will be lost during data migration to a new version of the linelist, so I advise you to restrict the modifications to graphs that you want to export to reports / slides, or which are really making your eyes bleed.We are going to start by looking at the analyses without filters on the data.\n\nGo to the patient data sheet, navigate to the OBT menu and click on the button to clear all filters. Then refresh analyses.\n\nNow that the data was refreshed, we can begin checking out the analyses sheets.\n\nPersons: uni and bivariate analyses\nThis page contains univariate and bivariate tables and bar charts providing information about patients: demographics, symptoms, outcomes etc.\n\nExplore the page, and answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the average length of stay of patients?\nHow many patients are more than 15 years old?\nHow many patients are female?\nWhat is the percentage of complicated measles?\nHow many patients are SAM?\nHow many patients died in the facility?\nHow many patients are male and less than 5 months old?\nHow many of the SAM patients are positive for the malaria RDT test?\n\n\nNow let us investigate the characteristics of deceased patients.\n\n\nGo back to the patient data sheet. Use the filters to select only the deceased patients (in the facility and/or the community, it‚Äôs up to you)\nHit the refresh button and go back to the analysis sheet.\n\n\nHow many female patients of age between one and four died?\nHow many of the deceased patients were MAM?\n\n\n\n\nTime: temporal analyses\nNow, let‚Äôs look at the ‚ÄúTemporal analyses‚Äù sheet. On this sheet you can choose the temporal scale you want to monitor: days, weeks, months, quarter, years. The table has 53 rows, and can thus accommodate up to:\n\na high resolution zoom of a given period of 53 days\none year worth of weeks\n53 months if you have several years worth of data\n53 quarters or years, which is a bit silly for most uses\n\n\n\n\nOptions for the temporal analyses\n\n\nBelow the tables are several epicurves corresponding to the content of the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this linelist, there is only one very large table. Some other linelists can have several tables, organised by sections, on top of each others. The graphs will always be a the bottom.\n\n\n\n\nRemove the filters on the data sheet and hit refresh.\nCheck the minimum and maximum date of notification: which units would you consider?\nFirst select the ‚ÄúWeek‚Äù unit. Which part of the data is not ploted?\nHow many patients were discharged during the 18th week of 2022?\nNow change the date of start of period to only plot the weeks of 2023.\nHow many patients were hospitalised in the second week of January 2023?\nChange the units to ‚ÄúMonth‚Äù. How many patients were admitted in January 2023?\n\n\nNow, if you went to have a look at the graphs, you should see one like that in the list of graphs:\n\n\n\nHospitalisations\n\n\nIt is fine to look at the shape of the epicurve, but you would not want to use it in a report as it is. Besides cosmetics improvements, you could use filters to remove the empty weeks at the right of the graph:\n\nSelect the graph: some buttons appear at the top right corner.\nUse the ‚Äúfilter‚Äù button (the bottom one) to filter out the categories you don‚Äôt want to see.\n\n\n\n\nMinimally pimped graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to remove the graph filters when new data is entered in the linelist, or else you won‚Äôt see it on the graph. The corrolary is that if your colleague sends you a linelist complaining that the figures are correct in the table but do not appear in the graph, the filters are the prime suspects.\n\n\n\n\nPlace: spatial analyses\nNow we navigate to the third analyses sheet. It displays the top 30 areas with the most cases, and below the top 30 places of origin (in the case of refugees and displaced people).10\n10¬†The number 30 is defined in the setup file: another disease might have 10 or 20.You can select the level at which you want to see the data displayed (admin 1 to 4).\n\nClick on the blue button ‚ÄúSelect your admin level‚Äù and go through the options. Which options have data in it? How many patients are there in Moissala Est?\n\nFor this linelist, data is meaningful at the ‚ÄúZone of responsibility‚Äù level (admin 3), but with real data even higher levers may be worth checking if people are travelling a lot, or if you created a master linelist from different files.\n\n\nPlace and person: spatio-temporal analyses\nThe last analysis sheet that you may encounter in an OBT linelist is a crossover between the temporal analysis and the spatial analysis: it allows you to look at the number of cases (usually) for a couple of chosen administrative levels across time.\n\n\nGo to the spatio-temporal analysis sheet\nPlace your cursor in one of the blue cells on the left (starting from C14 and down).\nClick on the ‚ÄúGeoHelper‚Äù button in the OBT menu and select Moissala Est (an admin 3)\nGo to the next blue cell and use the Geohelper to select another place of interest (for example, one of the top places from the Spatial analysis sheet, or a place that you noticed had recent cases).\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatio temporal analysis"

A fix in the OBT is coming from 2025 onwards, but if this happens with an older linelist:\n11¬†We saw the problem hit computers between November and December 2024\nHit the F9 key to force recalculation (or use the ‚ÄúCalculate now‚Äù button from the ‚ÄúFormula‚Äù Excel menu)\nThen hit the ‚ÄúRefresh analyses‚Äù button from the OBT menu\n(Advised): ask if there is a more recent version of the linelist with the problem solved\n\nAlternately, you can turn off this option if it bothers you in general.\n\n\n\nSending the data to the dashboard\nAnother source of friction is the sharing step of the linelist. In all cases, it is good to brief them on the steps to send data to the dashboard, but see if you can find the exact problems with these files:\n\nThey used OneDrive to share the linelist with EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org and received an error\nThey send the file measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb to EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org and received an error\nThey sent measles_linelist_moissala_export_data_20250203-1136.xlsx to EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org and received an error\nThey sent MSL_linelist__MSL24__info_country_code__info_organisation__info_facility_name__anonymous__vb-1003__20250103-1541 to EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org and probably did not receive an error, but the data does not appear in Chad in the dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file to send should be named MSL_linelist__MSL24__TCD__MSF-OCP__Mandoul Hospital__anonymous__vb-1003__20250103-1541\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\nEither they sent the linelist itself, the wrong export, or the good export but they did not fill the ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù sheet so the metadata could not be used in the name\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\nSometimes the problem is less obvious or could have multiple causes, and you will need to investigate a bit more.\n\nOpen the Excel file troubleshooting.xlsb from the tutorial archive.\n\nYour colleague contacts you. They have data for the start of January 2023, and they looked at the analyses sheets. But the analyses seem broken, even though they refreshed the data.\nProblem 1. They know they have positive measles cases, but these cases do not show up in the univariate table / graph about measles test results.\nProblem 2. The register says there should be 25 notifications in the first week, and 40 in the second week, but the numbers in the epicurve do not match. The univariate general summary is correct, though (65 patients seen).\nProblem 3. They know there should be 5 deceased patients in the facility, 3 who had been notified in week 1, and 2 notified in week 2. But the numbers in the temporal analysis sheet do not correspond.\n\nFigure out what the problems are. If the problems are quick to fix, do it. Think about the guidance you should provide your colleagues with to avoid these problems or troubleshoot them themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 1. Check out the authorised and entered values for the incriminated column (use filters!).\nProblem 2. The temporal analyses rely on dates, by definition.\nProblem 3. There are several sources to this problem. Maybe one less depending on what you did in past steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore hints\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Are the dates correct? Are the values of the outcome column correct? If yes, what else could affect a graph based on epiweeks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWink Wink Nudge Nudge\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Maybe go check Section¬†4.2 to see if there is an option you could check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 1. They did not use the dropdown menu in the lab result column and somehow forced a value not from the list (‚ÄúPos‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù)\nProblem 2. The notification date has some very dirty values that were not recognised as dates. As such, these notifications cannot be counted in the temporal analyses, because the conditions on the date cannot be met. Since the univariate summary has no conditions on dates, it is not affected.\nProblem 3. One of the notification date was dirty and not recognised as a date. But maybe that was solved during the second problem if you felt confident about the dates. One of the values of the outcome column had a typo. Finally, the start of the week somehow got changed to Sunday, while it should be Monday in Chad, and one of the rows was affected by that. Have a look at the epiweek column, change the start of the week and check the column again (recalculate if needed).\n\n\n\nThe last problem is tricky, but it could happen easilly in a country where the start of the week is not the same as the default (Monday) and someone forgot to change it before using the file."

You want to go and monitor the number of cases in Chad.\n\n\nAccess the dashboard\nYou need an account to connect to Epicentre dashboard. The creation of this account is semi-automatic for MSF addresses: go to this page.12\n12¬†If you do not have an MSF address but think you should have access to a dashboard, contact the EpiDS team.Once you have an account, you can go to the intersection dashboard site and connect with the account you created.\n\n\nSidebar filters\nOn the left (number 1 on Figure¬†2) you have the options sidebar, where you can filter data (diseases, OC, country, site, outcome etc.) and customise a couple of options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\nPick ‚ÄúMeasles‚Äù from the filter\nFind the country filter and select ‚ÄúChad‚Äù\nClick on the ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù button at the bottom to apply the selected filters on the data.\n\n\nThe dashboard now only displays measles data in Chad.\n\n\nMap\nFirst let‚Äôs look at the map.\n\n\nZoom on the map to better see what‚Äôs happening in Chad.\nSelect the ADM1 level to get a better resolution.

How many patients do not have (matched) geo data at this level?\nSelect the ADM3 level to see if we have enough data at that level? What do you think?\n\n\nThe top of the map displays an ‚Äúoptions‚Äù button that allow you to tweak circle size to reduce overlap and group data by a couple of variables.\n\nGroup data by whether patients are hospitalised or not. Do you see a difference between Moissala and Djodo Gassa?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nThere is a button on the left of the map (number 3 on Figure¬†2) that allows you to change the background of the map and hide / show the bubbles or attack rates to increase readability.\nClick on a region to update the epicurve and age pyramid data for only the patients from this region.

A ‚ÄúReset zoom‚Äù button will appear to undo the view.\nClick on a bar to update the map and the age pyramid to show only the data related to that time period. A blue band indicated the selected bar. Click on the bar a second time to unselect it.\nClick on legend item to unselect them and only show some categories. For example, in the above graph you could show only the hospitalised patients in two clicks, which is slightly faster than using the sidebar filters in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow explore\n\nExplore the dashboard to answer the following questions:\n\nWhen was the dashboard last updated for measles? (hint: no need to go into sub-menus, it is written on the main page)\nIn 2024, which country had the most measles cases? How many children of less than 6 months were notified? And girls specifically?\nWhen was the dashboard last updated for Hepatitis E?\nHow many cholera consultations did MSF OCG performed in the last 90 days?"
