    "text": "Linelist\n\n\n\nOutbreakTools menu in OBT linelists\n\n\n\nData table\n\n\n\nButtons acting on data tables\n\n\n\nShow / Hide variables\nClicking on the “Show/hide variables” button opens a window listing all the variables in this linelist sheet.\n\n\n\nShow hide button and pop-up window\n\n\nVariable can have three visibility status:\n\nMandatory: variables cannot be hidden with the Show/Hide\nShown: variables are currently visible but can be hidden by ticking “Hide” on the right\nHide: variables are currently hidden but can be made visible by ticking “Show” on the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can hide all optional variables in one go by clicking on the “Hide all optional variables” button.\nThis is useful if you want to create a minimal linelist and the linelist has a lot of variables shown by default.\nAfter use, the button will change to “Show all optional variables”, to allow the reverse action.\n\n\n\n\nAdd rows\nBy default, the linelist has 200 empty lines. But you can add more when these are filled. Click on the “Add Rows” button to add 200 new empty rows.\n\n\nResize table\nClick on the “Resize table” button to remove any empty row at the end or in the middle of the linelist.\n\n\nClear all filters\nTo remove all the filters at once, click on the “Clear all filters” button. This is useful if you applied several filters across the table and want to reverse to the full view without missing one.\n\n\nSort the variable\nIf you need to visualize your data by sorting on specific variables, you need to use the sorting function. Place the cursor in a cell of the variable you want to sort (from line 9) and click on the button.\nThe first time you click, you have a message to confirm the action, once you click yes, you cannot undo it. The first time it sorts by ascending order, if you click again, it will sort by descending order.\n\n\nWeek start\nChose the day that starts the week in your country using the “Week start” button. The selected value will be applied to the whole linelist (calculated epiweeks, as well as in the analyses).\nWhen you click on the button, a pop up window appears, where you can select the day of the week. Then close the window.\n\n\nAutofit columns\nUse this button to improve column width so that the columns take less space. The fit takes into account the label, the length of categories of the variable (if any) and the name of the variable (hidden).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can manually modify the width of columns in the linelist table to adjust to content the way you would do in any Excel file.\n\n\n\n\nGeoHelper\nThe GeoHelper is a popup window that helps you entering geographic data surch as the origin of the patient or the name of the facility. It is mostly used to enter data on the patient data sheet, but it is also useful on the Spatio-Temporal analysis sheet.\nTo use it, place your cursor in a “geo” or “hf” column (you can recognise them thanks to the orange headers), in the admin 1 level. Click on the “GeoHelper” button, or hit the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + G. It opens a window, with several tabs, depending on whether you are in a geo (described by four visible columns) or in hf (described by one visible column).\nIf you are in a geo section, you will have three tabs that you can use to select administrative levels.\n\nCascade: select the admin levels with cascading menus, by selecting one admin level after the other, starting from the highest one.\nSearch: search by typing the name (needs at least 3 letters)\nHistory: quickly find a previous entry entered through the GeoHelper (does not work for data entered using the regular cascading dropdowns).\n\nOnce the location has been found, select it and click on “OK”.\n\n\n\nRefresh analyses\n\n\n\nRefresh analyses button\n\n\nHit the “Refresh analyses” button to update analyses on all analyses sheets in one go. You should use it whenever you entered new data or when you applied filters to existing data and want to see the analyses on this subset of data.1\n1 Do not forget to remove the filters and refresh the analyses at the end to not be confused but the numbers in a couple of days\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the numbers in the analyses are struck, it is because of a new Excel functionality. The documentation is limited and we have not been able to modify the refresh button to take it into account yet. You have two options: use the F9 shortcut before hitting “Refresh analyses”, or un-tick the “Format Stale Values” option in the Calculation options of the Formula tab of Excel options.\n\n\n\nExcel Calculation options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImports\n\n\n\nImports section\n\n\n\nImport data\nThe « Import Data » button allows you to import data in the linelist. This data must be in a special format typically produced by exporting data from another OutbreakTools linelist for the same disease.\nFirst a window opens to select the file to import. Select it and click on “OK”. At the end, a message will inform you of the success and provide a little import report is you wish so. Inspect it to see if there are any unexpected discrepancies (loosing variables should be investigated!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe same button is used whether the data was generated with the “Export data button” from the Exports section2 or the “Export for migration” button from the Advanced section of the ribbon3.\n\n\n3 This export contains all the columns, and as much metadata as possible2 This data may or may not be anonymised, contain all columns or have extensive metadata depending on how the exports are encodedIf there is already data in the file, a message will inform you of that fact and ask you what you wish to do. It is possible to append the new data at the bottom of the already present data. This is a handy way to create temporary master linelists, or to gather data entered by two data-encoders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure the data is not overlapping before importing, as the import will just paste the data at the bottom of the existing data, and you would end up with duplicates to clean manually.\n\n\n\n\nImport geobase\nThe “Import geobase” button allows you to import a geobase in the linelist. If the current linelist had already a geobase, it will be replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe import of the geobase does not affect the data already entered in the linelist, it only fills the modalities offered by dropdown menus. If data is already present in the linelist and the new geobase has different levels, you need to correct them yourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nExports\nOutbreakTools linelists have the feature to export data in a separated excel file, to share with partners or perform more advance analyses. The characteristics of the exports (which variables, anonymisation or not, password protected or not etc.) are pre-defined in the setup file that is used to generate the linelist.\nThe regular exports buttons are available in the “Export section” of the ribbon, and the “Export for migration” is available in the Advanced section of the ribbon.\n\n\n\nExports section\n\n\n\nExport data\nWhile Epicentre linelists should have at minima be an “Anonymous export for MSF” button, the other available exports differ between linelists created.\nTo export data, click on the “Export Data” button, which opens a popup window, with several options. At the top, you will see buttons for different exports. After clicking on the desired export, a window pops-up for saving the export. If “Export Filtered Data” is selected, a confirmation message will pop-up first to ask you whether this is what you really want.\nOnce the folder has been selected and after clicking “OK”, a new window opens to confirm the export and, if the export is protected, provide the associated password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you forgot the password, click on the “Export Button” again, and then click on the “Show actual private key” to display the password again.\nClick on the button “Generate new password” to change the password used by default.\n\n\n\n\nExport analyses\nYou can export all the tables from the analysis sheets in one document by using the “Export the analysis sheets” button and selecting the directory where you want to save them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf the analysis are made on filtered data, the tables will be exported as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf the export fails with the graphs not exported, it may be a memory problem: close some applications or wait for your antivirus to have finished is scan and try again.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister and Case report form\nYou can print a register directly based on the linelist.\n\n\n\nRegister and case report form section\n\n\nThe features from this category only work if you are on a data entry sheet, otherwise you get an error message.\nClick on “Show register”; it opens a new sheet that contains all the variables from the linelist. On this sheet, you can use the Data Table features as in the original linelist sheet:\n\n“Add rows” and “Resize table” work exactly the same (except that it adds 10 rows at once)\n“Show/Hide variables” works the same but looks a bit different. Instead of “Show” you can select “print” and the orientation of the header. You can also import the parametrisation of hidden/shown columns from the regular linelist table, or change column width.\n\nYou can rotate all the labels at once by clicking the “Rotate headers” button. You can define the heigh of the row by clicking directly on “Row height”, a pop-up opens where you can define the heigh.\nAll labels are editable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou should hide all calculated variable, they have no place in a printed register book\n\n\nOnce customized, you can hide the sheet by clicking the red cross, all your modifications are saved.\nOnce ready, you can use the “Print” button to open the print preview view (whether you are on the register sheet or the linelist sheet). If you are satisfied, you can print.\n\n\nAdvanced\nThere is an “Advanced” button on the right of the ribbon, that opens a popup window with options that are used less often.\n\n\n\nAdvanced button and pop-up window\n\n\n\nExport for migration\nThis button exports raw data and metadata for migration to another linelist file.4\n4 Whether that is to upgrade versions, move out of a corrupt file or create a temporary master-linelistYou can choose to export the patient data and/or the geobase and/or the history of the geobase (history list in the GeoHelper). There are also options to include metadata on the state of hidden/shown columns (to not have to redo the configuration in the new file), and the updated labels of the custom variables, if you used these variables.\n\n\n\nExport for migration\n\n\nAfter selecting the options and clicking on “Export”, a window pops-up for saving the export. Select the folder and click on “OK”. Once finished a message appears to ask if you want to close the window.\nThe export creates up to three files depending on the options you selected:\n\na file containing the data and metadata\na file containing the geobase that is currently in the linelist, as well as the history from the GeoHelper\na file containing *only the GeoHelper **history*5\n\n5 This option is useful if you want to upgrade to a new version of the geobase but wish to keep your GeoHelper history\n\nImport geobase history\nThis button allows you to import a file containing the history of the geobase only (such a file was created by exporting the data from migration, see above).\n\n\nLast Import Report\nThe button allows you to display the report from the last import made.\n\n\nDelete data or geobase history\nThis are a dangerous buttons that allows you to delete data or geobase history from the linelist.\n“Delete all data” allows you to remove all the data you entered from the workbook. After clicking, you will have a warning message. To confirm the deletion, you will need to enter the full name of the file.\n“Delete geobase history” allows you to empty the table with the geobase history so the list of suggestion of the history method from the GeoHelper will be empty.\n\n\nRestore the state of hidden columns\nThis button allows you to restore the state of hidden columns (i.e. hide them all again) if, for any reasons these columns had been shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that hidden columns are not supposed to be shown, and the user can thus not modify their visibility state from the regular Show/Hide variables button, hence this button."

Of course, you will need to keep in mind that the data will be only partial for these variables (you have it only up to a date, or conversely from a date onwards).For the sake of brevity of the exercise, here you will only perform a couple of actions.\n\nGo to the “Linelist patients” sheet. Then click on the “Show/Hide variables” button. Hide all the optional variables, then unhide:\n\nReporting health facility name\nFever\nMaculopapular rash\nCough\nRed eyes - Conjonctivitis\nMUAC\nPregnant\nThe custom variables at the end\nAny calculated variables that you wished to see displayed for information of quick filtering (epi week? ager group? etc.)\n\n\n\n\nPrint a register\n\nClick on the “Show register” button in the OBT menu.\n\nThis opens a usually hidden sheet (that can be hidden again when you are done) to prepare a paper register if you don’t already have one in the site.\nTypically, there will be less columns in the register than the full linelist, as some information may come from patient files or other sources.\n\n\nClick on the “Show/Hide variables” button to open the popup window for the register.\nClick on the “Match the show/hide from linelist” to align the register visibility on the linelist configuration as a start.\nHide variables that are not needed in the register\n\n\nNow that you have selected the variables to print, you will likely have to adjust the register to make it more user-friendly:\n\nTweak column width so that the data encoder have the space to write\nChange labels orientation, to save some space (for columns with short content)\nAdd rows to the table until it fits one page5\n\n5 Hint: there is a button in the OBT menu for that!\nAdjust the width of the following columns:\n\nPatient name: wider\nSex: narrower\n\nClick on the “Print” button in the OBT menu to open the Print Preview. Note the “Settings” button to control some of the printing options.\nWhen you are finished, you can exit the Print Preview, and hit the “Close Register / CRF” button to hide the register sheet (your modifications are still here).\n\n\n\nPrepare a Case Report Form\nSimilarly to what you did for the register, it is possible to print a CRF from the linelist if you don’t have one available. A button unhides a sheet displaying an automatically prepared draft for a CRF. There is still work to do on it to make it user-friendly but it’s a start.\nThings that you might do:\n\nHide variables that are collected elsewhere or calculated\nHide/condense the lines\nShorten some labels6\n\n6 There now is an option in the setup file to provide shorter labels for the CRF from the start to reduce the time fixing label overlap, but they have not been filled for all linelists yet.Preparing a clean CRF is out of the scope of this tutorial, but do not hesitate to open the view (“Show CRF” button) to have a peak at it before hiding it again.\n\n\n\nSend the linelist\nYou have done the main customisation of the linelist. Do not forget to save the customised template.\nYou can now send you to your colleagues. If they have worked with OBT linelist before (even for other diseases) this should be easy: all the OBT linelists have the same functionalities. If they have not worked with OBT linelist before, you should brief them on:\n\nUnblocking the file and authorising VBA macro\nFinding the OBT menu\nFilling the remaining metadata on the “Info” sheet\nExporting files to send to the dashboard\nUsing the GeoHelper\n\nIn most cases there should be one linelist per site."

    "text": "Part 2: Linelist in use\n\n🧭 Context\nThe linelist is used in Moissala and the neighbouring areas. You receive the file with data and you want to have a look at it.\nYou are now going to work on the file measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb, which contains simulated measles data.\n\n\nSanity checks\nWhen you receive an unknown linelist with data, always perform a couple of checks to get a feel of the state of the file and data. These are not the extensive checks you would perform if you were tasked to monitor data entry and quality, or to perform analyses. They might however rapidly hint at the source of a reported problem (a functionality not working as expecting).\n\nStructure checks\n\nDoes the OBT menu appear as expected?\nTest one button (for example, open the Show/Hide window)\nDo you see the expected sheets?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf the ribbon buttons have weird labels or no labels at all, it means that the VBA is not activated or crashed. Check your VBA settings, close the file and re-open it.\nIf the problem persist, attempt an “Export for migration” to move the data to a new empty template.\nIf the export does not work because the VBA is corrupted, contact the EpiDS team to get help migrating the data.\n\n\n\nDo these checks on the file.\n\n\n\nData checks\n\nAre the metadata on the “Info” sheet still (correctly) filled?7\nDo patients have IDs?\nAre there replicated IDs?\nCheck the filters of a couple of date columns: do the dates correspond to what you expect (min, max) and are there values not recognised as dates?\nCheck a couple of categorical columns (sex, outcome…) to see if the categories entered correspond to the expected values.\nRemove any filters applied on the data (there is a shortcut for that in the OBT menu).\n\n7 90% of export problems come from badly filled metadata\n\n\nAnalyses\nNow let’s investigate the descriptive analyses provided with the linelist. While the interface of the linelist is the same, the provided analyses may differ a bit from disease to disease, depending on what was requested, and what is encoded in the setup file8. Most linelists have at least the uni and bivariate tables, the temporal and spatial analyses.\n8 Note that more analyses can be requested if neededThere are a couple of important things about the analyses:\n\nThe most important thing to remember about analyses in the OBT linelist is that they need to be refreshed before being explored.\n\n\n\n\nRefresh button in the OBT menu\n\n\n\nThe second most important thing to know is that if you filter data in the main patient sheet, it will be reflected in the analyses after you refresh (a red warning will appear to remind you).\nYou can alter the appearance of the graphs (which are created automatically and admittedly a bit ugly), the same way you would do for your own figures, with any Excel tool.9\n\n9 Note that graphs modifications will be lost during data migration to a new version of the linelist, so I advise you to restrict the modifications to graphs that you want to export to reports / slides, or which are really making your eyes bleed.We are going to start by looking at the analyses without filters on the data.\n\nGo to the patient data sheet, navigate to the OBT menu and click on the button to clear all filters. Then refresh analyses.\n\nNow that the data was refreshed, we can begin checking out the analyses sheets.\n\n\nPersons: uni and bivariate analyses\nThis page contains univariate and bivariate tables and bar charts providing information about patients: demographic informations, but also symptoms, outcomes etc.\n\nExplore the page, and answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the average length of stay of the patients?\nHow many patients are more than 15 years old?\nHow many patients are female?\nWhat is the percentage of complicated measles?\nHow many patients are SAM?\nHow many patients died in the facility?\nHow many patients are male and less than 5 months old?\nHow many of the SAM patients are positive for the malaria RDT test?\n\n\nNow let us investigate the characteristics of deceased patients.\n\n\nGo back to the patient data sheet. Use the filters to select only the deceased patients (in the facility and/or the community, it’s up to you)\nHit the refresh button and go back to the analysis sheet.\n\n\nHow many female patients of age between one and four died?\nHow many of the deceased patients were MAM?\n\n\n\n\nTime: temporal analyses\nNow, let’s look at the “Temporal analyses” sheet. On this sheet you can choose the temporal scale you want to monitor: days, weeks, months, quarter, years. The table has 53 rows, and can thus accommodate up to:\n\na high resolution zoom of a given period of 53 days\none year worth of weeks\n53 months if you have several years worth of data\n53 quarters or years (but we do not expect you to often use these scales)\n\n\n\n\nOptions for the temporal analyses\n\n\nBelow the tables are several epicurves corresponding to the content of the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this linelist, there is only one very large table. Some other linelists can have several tables, organised by sections, on top of each others. The graphs will always be a the bottom.\n\n\n\n\nRemove the filters on the data sheet and hit refresh.\nCheck the minimum and maximum date of notification: which units would you consider?\nFirst select the “Week” unit. Which part of the data is not ploted?\nHow many patients were discharged during the 18th week of 2022?\nNow change the date of start of period to only plot the weeks of 2023.\nHow many patients were hospitalised in the second week of January 2023?\nChange the units to “Month”. How many patients were admitted in January 2023?\n\n\nNow, if you went to have a look at the graphs, you should see one like that in the list of graphs:\n\n\n\nHospitalisations\n\n\nIt is fine to look at the shape of the epicurve, but you would not want to use it in a report as it is. Beside cosmetic improvement, you can use filters to remove the empty weeks at the right of the graph:\n\nSelect the graph -&gt; some buttons appear at the top right corner.\nUse the “filter” button (the bottom one) to filter out the categories you don’t want to see.\n\n\n\n\nMinimally pimped graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to remove the graph filters when new data is entered in the linelist, else you won’t see it on the graph. The corrolary is that if your colleague sends you a linelist complaining that the figures are correct in the table but do not appear in the graph, the filters are the prime suspects.\n\n\n\n\nPlace: spatial analyses\nNow we navigate to the third analyses sheet. It displays the top 30 areas with the most cases, and below the top 30 places of origin (in the case of refugees and displaced people).10\n10 The number 30 is defined in the setup file: another disease might have 10 or 20.You can select the level at which you want to see the data displayed (admin 1 to 4).\n\nClick on the blue button “Select your admin level” and go through the options. Which options have data in it? How many patients are there in Moissala Est?\n\nFor this linelist, data is meaningful at the “Zone of responsibility” level (admin 3), but with real data even higher levers may be worth checking if people are travelling a lot, or if you created a master linelist from different files.\n\n\nPlace and person: spatio-temporal analyses\nThe last analysis sheet that may be in an OBT linelist is a crossover between the temporal analysis and the spatial analysis: it allow you to look at the number of cases (usually) for a couple of chosen administrative levels across time.\n\n\nGo to the Spatio-temporal analysis sheet\nPlace your cursor in one of the blue cells on the left (starting from C14 and down).\nClick on the “GeoHelper” button in the OBT menu and select Moissala Est (an admin 3)\nGo to the next blue cell and use the Geohelper to select another place of interest (for example, one of the top places from the Spatial analysis sheet, or a place that you noticed had recent cases).\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatio temporal analysis"

    "text": "Presentation of OutbreakTools\n\nConcept\nThe main idea of OutbreakTools linelist generation is to separate the content of the linelist (which variables and analyses are in the linelist) from the file interface and functionalities.2\n2 An idea that is not novel, as separating content and presentation (or style) is a classic idea, that you find in HTML/CSS, Markdown, Latex or even using styles in Word3 You can think of the setup file as a recipe for a given linelist.4 If you think of the setup file as a recipe, the designer is the food processor.The content is described in a setup file, a special Excel file that allows describing all the variables and the analyses that should go in the linelist.3 Another Excel file, the designer, reads the setup file and runs scripts to generate a linelist. The designer creates the whole linelist structure, adds the buttons and many functionalities.4\n\n\n\nCreating a linelist with Outbreaktools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe module 2 teaches you how to modify a setup file and compile a linelist\n\n\nThe advantages of this approach are:\n\nSomeone with no knowledge of VBA can use the OBT tools to build or modify a linelist, as long as they know how to fill a setup file.\nThe maintenance of functionalities is done by a specialist in Epicentre, who generates new versions of the designer. Upon update of the designer, linelists can be regenerated in a couple of minutes to incorporate the updates.5\n\n5 Which is not an instantaneous process, but infinitely faster than manually porting code and fixes from one linelist to a different one with lots of code adaptation, and then migrating data, with more or less hasle depending on the linelist.\n\nOutbreakTools Workflow\nIn addition to linelist development, OBT contains tools that rely on the standardised nature of the linelists to build data cleaning workflow and dashboard much faster than ever before. When a new linelist is created, a simple functional dashboard can be build in a couple of days, with automatic data gathering from a mail address.\nThe full workflow allows epidemiologists or data teams to send their data to Epicentre for it to be displayed on a dashboard. The data will usually be displayed between one or two hours after being sent.\n\n\n\nThe linelist-to-dashboard workflow"

    "text": "XXXX OutbreakTools linelists\nThis section will describe linelists functionalities.\n\nA note on languages\nA given setup file can contain several languages, so as long as the translation for a language is provided, the designer can compile a linelist in this language. All the created linelists will thus have the same interface, variable names and functionalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause the translations of all labels and categories are available in the setup file, the compilation scripts can automatically translate the data received in different language to English, which allow to gather all the data in the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nA note on geographic data\nDescribing geographic data is a huge challenge for patient data (independently of the software used). The problem is usually that it is hard to access geographic levels to describe places in all the countries that we work in: the data may change over time, is often incomplete, and sometimes several source of data contradict each others\nIn OBT linelists, as in many linelists developed before, we made the arbitrary choice to describe geographic locations with fours hierarchical administrative levels. So each location is associated with four columns with cascading dropdown menus and several hidden calculated columns.\nThe categories with which to populate dropdown menus are country specific. A member of the EpiDS team is tasked to gather geographic data from different places (GIS unit, OCHA HDX, local GIS officers etc.) and create database of geographic locations associated with shapefiles (files to plot geographic data). As a part of OutbreakTools, we provide Excel tabulated versions of this data, the so-called geobases, which can be imported very easily in OBT linelists to fill the dropdown menus for locations. These geobases are accessible online in the Geoapp.\nGeographical location are encoded using four columns that can accommodate up to four administrative levels, and these columns have a special status in OBT. You can recognize them by the orange background of their labels. When you import a geobase in a linelist:\n\nThe labels of the columns are updated with the administrative levels present in the geobase (e.g. “adm1_name” will change to “Province” for DRC).\nThe categories of the dropdown menus update. You can fill the variables either by using the cascading dropdown menus, or by using the GeoHelper button from the ribbon."

As a consequence, all linelists created by the EpiDS team can generate password-protected anonymous data, ready to be sent to Epicentre for compilation and visualisation.\nIf you are using a linelist for which a dashboard was developed, you can send data to Epicentre. The scripts run automatically every hours, so you can choose the frequency at which you send the data depending on your needs.\nSteps:\n\nClean your data as much as you can. Pay special attention to dates (date format, date in the future, impossible dates…) and geographic data (see Note 1)\nMake sure that the general information metadata is properly filled (country, site name, section) as this data is used by the compilation script.\nClear filters: you need to send the whole dataset, not only the current week (see Important 1)\nHit F9/“Recalculate now” Excel button to update all formulas.\nExport data using the “Export data” button of the OutbreakTools menu, and chose the “Anonymous export to MSF” option (or a similar name). You will be prompted for a place to save the genarated export.\nSend the data to epi-data [at] epicentre.msf.org without renaming the file.\nRince and repeat for all the sites/linelists.\n\nThe file generated is a password protected excel file, which you can open if you want to see what it looks like. It has the “Info” sheet and patient data, as well as some automatically generated metadata (language, linelist version etc.). The name of the export file is generated automatically based on the matadata you filled so make sure these data are filled correctly once and for all.\nIf their metadata are filled correctly1, you can send several exports in the same mail (from different sites, or even different diseases), the scripts will parse the name of the export to sort the files on our side.\n1 Yes, we are insisting on this part. Ask us why.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: Geodata matching\n\n\n\nThe dashboard displays a map where you can visualise data at several administrative levels (1 up to 4 depending on the resolution of the data sent). For patients to appear on the map at a given resolution level, their geolocations needs to match the geobase for this level because the geobase loaded with the linelist corresponds to shapes used to create maps.\nIf a place of origin cannot be matched for a given level (e.g. health area), the patient will not be included on the map at the “health area” level resolution.2 If the above level (here the health zone) is matched, the patient will be accounted in the health zone resolution map.\nThe patient will be counted in other tables/graphs as long as the relevant information is filled, regardless of the geomatching.\n\n\n2 There is a small note under the graph telling you how many patients are not matched\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 1\n\n\n\nOnly the last occurrence of data you send is loaded on the dashboard.\nConsequently, it is perfectly fine to correct past data even if you sent it previously: past exports will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
