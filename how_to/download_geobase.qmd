Geobases contain description of geographic locations, encoded by four administrative levels. You can download one for your linelist with the following steps: 

1. In you internet browser, go to the [Geoapp](https://reports.msf.net/secure/app/outbreak-tools-geoapp). 

2. Use your account to connect. If you do not have one already, create one [here]( https://reports.msf.net/signup/) first then connect to the Geoapp.

3. Select one *or more* countries from the dropdown menu in the top left of the screen. The Admin 1 regions of each country will be rendered on the map.

4. Click on the regions you require geo data for. Selected regions turn red. If you want to select the whole country, click the "Select all regions" button under the country dropdown menu. Once one region has been selected, buttons to inspect and download the data will appear below the country dropdown menu.

5. Click on the "Download Geobase" button to download the data for the selected regions in an excel format that can be directly imported into an OutbreakTools linelist.
