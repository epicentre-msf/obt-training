title: "Get a linelist template"
---

As of now, there is no open SharePoint with all the OBT linelist accessible, but there are several ways to obtain a template:^[There are discussions in the Epinetwork to setup an open SharePoint with all the latest versions of tools so this part should be much straightforward soon]

- You have access to the current Epinetwork SharePoint, where all the last versions of the existing OBT tools are stored: go and get the most recent file for the disease

- This is a big project, maybe with several OCs and a SharePoint was setup with the linelist template (as was the case for Haiti, EastAfrica measles and cholera, mpox, Diphtheria etc.)

- You ask your epi-advisor (or equivalent position from your OC) who can access the Epinetwork Sharepoint

- You can contact the EpiDS team who can send you the last version.

Always check the date in the template files name! As OBT tools are still in development, there are often new versions with new functionalities or bug fixes. Dictionaries might also be updated if there was a request for it. So if the date is more than four or five months old, it is best to check if there is a more recent version.

If someone handled you a file that is more than one year old, definitely ask around for newer versions!
