title: "Use the GeoHelper"
---

The **GeoHelper** is a popup window that helps you entering geographic data such as the residence or the origin of the patient. 

It is mostly used to enter data on patient data sheets, but it is also useful on the "Spatio-Temporal analysis" sheet.

To use it, place your cursor in a `geo` or `hf` column (you can recognise them to to their orange headers), in the *admin 1 level*. Click on the "GeoHelper" button in the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon), or hit the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + G`. It opens a window with several tabs, depending on whether you are in a `geo` (described by four visible columns) or in `hf` (described by one visible column).

If you are in a "geo" section, you will have three tabs that you can use to select administrative levels.

- **Cascade**: select the admin levels with cascading menus, by selecting one admin level after the other, starting from the highest one. 

- **Search**: search by typing the name (needs at least 3 letters)

- **History**: quickly find a previous entry entered through the GeoHelper (does not work for data entered using the regular cascading dropdowns).

Once the location has been found, select it and click on “OK”.
