[OutbreakTools]{.h1}

**OutbreakTools** is a set of solutions designed by [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/) [EpiDS team](https://apps.epicentre-msf.org/public/) to quickly create linelists to collect field data during outbreaks. These linelists have a number of functionalities including descriptive analyses, buttons to migrate data to or from the linelist, or to import geographic data to better describe locations.

[Training]{.h1}

This site contains two modules to familiarise yourself with OBT linelists. Each module contains an introduction to the concepts and a self-paced tutorial to learn by doing.
