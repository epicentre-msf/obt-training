This module presents the **OutbreakTools toolkit** (OBT), with a focus on OBT linelists. 

It is dedicated to people who prepare and deploy linelists on the field, as well as support colleagues with linelist data (from HQ or in the field).

The training aims at giving you autonomy with the preparation, use and troubleshooting of the file.

**Tentative length:** 3h


## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

After this training, you should be able to:

-	**Explain** what is the OutbreakTools (OBT) tool kit and make decisions about when it is appropriate to use it
-	**Prepare** a linelist for deployment
-	**Explain** the functionalities of the file to others
-	**Use** the main functionalities (import data, export data, migrate data etc.) as well as well less known tricks
-	**Troubleshoot** the most commons problems
-	**Monitor** data on the intersection dashboard


## Prerequiste

A good experience of Excel files. There is no need for VBA esoteric skills nor advanced formula wizardry. Instead, we expect you to know your way around a multi-sheets Excel file, to know of filters, how to force calculation, use dropdown menus, modify graph appearance, use basic pivot tables etc.


## Syllabus

The training is based on an explicative document (on the site, or slides), and a self-paced tutorial. The tutorial is based on three situations that you are likely to encounter:

-	You want to **deploy a linelist** in a country: getting the file, preparing it for deployment
- You sent the file to the field but a data encoder has issues with it: you need to know how to **troubleshoot the most common problems**
-	The file is in use, you need to **monitor data**, both in the linelist and in the dashboard
