This module presents the **OutbreakTools toolkit** (OBT), with a focus on OBT linelists. 

It is dedicated to people who prepare and deploy linelists on the field, as well as support colleagues with linelist data (from HQ or in the field).

The training aims at giving you autonomy with the preparation, use and troubleshooting of the file.

**Tentative length:** 3h


## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

After this training, you should be able to:

-	Explain what is the OutbreakTools (OBT) toolkit and make decisions about when it is appropriate to use it
-	Retrieve a linelist, prepare it for deployment
-	Explain the functionalities of the file to others
-	Use the main functionalities (import data, export data, migrate data etc.) as well as well less known tricks
-	Troubleshoot the most commons problems
-	Navigate to the intersection dashboard to monitor data


## Prerequiste

A good experience of Excel files. There is no need for VBA esoteric skills nor even advanced formula wizardry. Instead, we expect you to know your way around a multi-sheets Excel file, to know of filters, how to force calculation, use dropdown menus, modify graph appearance, use basic pivot tables etc.


## Syllabus

The training is based on a mix of slides/text and tutorial. The tutorial will be based on three situations that you are likely to encounter:

-	You want to deploy a linelist in a country: getting the file, preparing it for deployment
- You sent the file to the field but a data encoder has issues with it: you need to know how to troubleshoot the most common ones.
-	The file is in use, you monitor data and perform data management tasks
