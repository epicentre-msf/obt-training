## Introduction

In this tutorial you will get to familiarise yourself with the OBT linelist interface^[Remember all OBT linelist have the same type of interface] and the corresponding dashboard.


### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 

- Explore functionalities of the OBT linelist, with a focus on troubleshooting the file and exploring analyses.
- Get access and understand how to use the intersection dashboard


### ðŸ§­ Context

A measles outbreak started in Chad, MSF decides to get involved in the response. A linelist is needed to collect patient data in structures. 

You discussed with the MedRef and the MedCo, and you came to the decision to deploy the OBT linelist.


### Activities

In this tutorial, you will get access to an empty linelist, to learn how to prepare a file before deployment, and to a linelist with false data to replicate a linelist in use.

You then will visit the Intersection dashboard to explore MSF measles data.


Explanations about the files will be given in simple text, or in "Tips" or "Note" boxes. Instructions for you to follow will be given in instructions boxes:

::: {.instructions}
This is an instruction: you will be asked to **do something**
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
This is a warning, it contains important information
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
This box contains tips: they are handy bits of informations that may be omitted in a first reading if you are in a hurry, but totally deserve some attention at some point.
:::



## Get ready

### Download and unzip the tutorial materials ðŸ“¦

The files that you are going to use are stored on Github, bundled in a `zip` archive. 

::: {.instructions}
1. Go to the [Github page](XXXXX) to download the archive. Save it on your computer (in your *Downloads* folder for example). 

2. Unzip the whole archive and save the files locally. It is better to save the unzipped folder in a location that is not actively synchronised with Onedrive at the moment.
:::


### Description of the folder content ðŸ“‚

- The current last version of the OBT measles linelist (standard version), empty
- A linelist with simulated data^[To ensure full anonymisation, the data used in this exercise was simulated, using parameters from MSF measles data for some parameters]
- A text file with the password


## Part 0: Unlock files and functionalities ðŸ”“

OBT linelists use VBA macros to add functionalities. As a consequence, linelists that comes from the internet often need to be unblocked, and macro enabled in them. 

::: {.instructions}
Unblock your linelist, or make sure it is already unlocked. If you have never done that before, [follow the steps from this page](../how_to/unblock_files.qmd)
:::

::: {.callout-note}
You may need to perform some or all these steps on your computer, but you will certainly have to explain them to your collaborators using the linelist.
:::


## Part 1: Prepare and deploy a linelist

### Gather the files

#### Get a linelist template

In real life you should [get an empty template](../how_to/get_template.qmd) but for this exercise you will use the template provided in the archive you downloaded.

::: {.instructions}
Identify the file and make a copy on which you can work.
:::



#### Download the geobase

::: {.instructions}
Go to the [Geoapp](https://reports.msf.net/secure/app/outbreak-tools-geoapp) and download a geobase for Tchad. A summary of the steps can be found [here](../how_to/download_geobase.qmd), or in the popup at site opening.
:::


The file is unprotected, you can open it to investigate its structure if you want to.


### Adapt the linelist {#sec-customise}

::: {.instructions}
Open the linelist (password: `measles2024`) and  inspect sheet names.
:::

**Notably**: 

- The first sheet contains some instructions, but there is nothing special to do with it
- The second sheet ("Info") contains project and site information
- The third sheet ("Linelist Patients") is to enter patient data
- Most of the following sheets are analyses.

::: {.instructions}
Find the [OutbreakTools Menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon), we are going to use it a lot in the rest of this tutorial.
:::


![OutbreakTools menu](../reference/images/ribbons-001-ll-ribbon.png){fig-align="center"}

#### Fill metadata

**Mandatory metadata**

::: {.instructions}
Fill the Information sheet (metadata):

- `Organisation`: enter your own section
- `Country`: Chad
- `Name of facility`: MoÃ¯ssala Hospital
:::

Once these fields are correctly filled, they should not be modified: the information will be used to name the exports.^[You may enter the name of the site yourself (if you are sending one or two linelists) or let the data encoders of each site enter fill it (if you are sending a linelist to many sites).]

**Optional metadata**

::: {.instructions}
Fill the following fields: `Admin 1` (Mandoul) and `Admin 2` (Moissala)
:::

#### Hide unused fields

You think that you do not need the rest of the fields. Let's hide them!

::: {.instructions}
Keep the "Info" sheet in focus and go to the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon). Click on the "Show / Hide variables" button.
:::

It opens a popup window:


![Opening the Show/hide window](../module_1/images/003-img-obt-show_hide.png){fig-align="center"}
You can see that some of the variables have the `Mandatory` status, but that some other have the `Shown` status. The former one cannot be hidden through this menu but the later can. 

::: {.instructions} 
Hide the variables that we do not plan to fill. You can either hide them one by one, or use the "Show all variables" button *twice* and unhide the variables you want to keep.
:::


#### Import the geobase

::: {.instructions} 
Use the "Import geobase" button from the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon) to import the geobase that you downloaded previously.
:::

#### Choose the start of the week.
  
::: {.instructions} 
Click on the "Week start" button to set up "Monday" as the first day of the week.
:::

#### Modify variable visibility

As for the "Info" sheet, you can hide or show optional variables in the patient data sheet. When you prepare a linelist, you will need to decide which variables to keep based on the needed information for this outbreak.^^[You can hide or unhide variables at a later stage. Of course, you will need to keep in mind that the data will be only partial for these variables (you have it only up to a date, or conversely from a date onwards).]

For the sake of brevity of the exercise, here you will only perform a couple of actions.

::: {.instructions} 
Go to the "Linelist patients" sheet. Then click on the "Show/Hide variables" button. Hide all the optional variables, then unhide:

- Reporting health facility name
- Fever
- Maculopapular rash
- Cough
- Red eyes - Conjonctivitis
- MUAC
- Pregnant
- The custom variables at the end
- Any calculated variables that you wished to see displayed for information of quick filtering (epi week? ager group? etc.)
:::



#### Print a register

::: {.instructions}
Click on the "Show register" button in the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon).
:::

This opens a usually hidden sheet (that can be hidden again when you are done) to prepare a paper register if you don't already have one in the site.

Typically, there will be less columns in the register than the full linelist, as some information may come from patient files or other sources.

::: {.instructions}

1. Click on the "Show/Hide variables" button to open the popup window for the register.

2. Click on the "Match the show/hide from linelist" to align the register visibility on the linelist configuration as a start.

3. Hide variables that are not needed in the register
:::


Now that you have selected the variables to print, you will likely have to adjust the register to make it more user-friendly:

- Tweak column width so that the data encoder have the space to write
- Change labels orientation, to save some space (for columns with short content)
- Add rows to the table until it fits one page^[Hint: there is a button in the OBT menu for that!]

::: {.instructions}
Adjust the width of the following columns:

- `Patient name`: wider
- `Sex`: narrower

Click on the "Print" button in the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon) to open the Print Preview. Note the "Settings" button to control some of the printing options.



When you are finished, you can exit the Print Preview, and hit the "Close Register / CRF" button to hide the register sheet (your modifications are still here).
:::

#### Prepare a Case Report Form

Similarly to what you did for the register, it is possible to print a CRF from the linelist if you don't have one available. A button unhides a sheet displaying an automatically prepared draft for a CRF. There is still work to do on it to make it user-friendly but it's a start.

Things that you might do: 

- Hide variables that are collected elsewhere or calculated
- Hide/condense the lines
- Shorten some labels^[There now is an option in the setup file to provide shorter labels for the CRF from the start to reduce the time fixing label overlap, but they have not been filled for all linelists yet.]

Preparing a clean CRF is out of the scope of this tutorial, but do not hesitate to open the view ("Show CRF" button) to have a peak at it before hiding it again.


### Send the linelist

You have done the main customisation of the linelist. Do not forget to save the customised template.

You can now send you to your colleagues. If they have worked with OBT linelist before (even for other diseases) this should be easy: all the OBT linelists have the same functionalities. If they have not worked with OBT linelist before, you should brief them on:

- [Unblocking the file and authorising VBA macro](../how_to/unblock_files.qmd)
- Finding the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon)
- Filling the remaining metadata on the "Info" sheet
- [Exporting files](../how_to/export_data_dashboard.qmd) to send to the dashboard
- Using the [GeoHelper](../how_to/use_geohelper.qmd)

In most cases there should be one linelist per site.




## Part 2: Linelist in use

### ðŸ§­ Context

The linelist is used in Moissala and the neighbouring areas. You receive the file with data and you want to have a look at it.

You are now going to work on the file `measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb`, which contains simulated measles data.


### Sanity checks

When you receive an unknown linelist with data, always perform a couple of checks to get a feel of the state of the file and data. These are not the extensive checks you would perform if you were tasked to monitor data entry and quality, or to perform analyses. They might however rapidly hint at the source of a reported problem (a functionality not working as expecting).

#### Structure checks

- Does the OBT menu appear as expected?
- Test one button (for example, open the Show/Hide window)
- Do you see the expected sheets?

::: {.callout-warning}
If the ribbon buttons have weird labels or no labels at all, it means that the VBA is not activated or crashed. Check your VBA settings, close the file and re-open it.


If the problem persist, attempt an "Export for migration" to move the data to a new empty template. 


If the export does not work because the VBA is corrupted, contact the EpiDS team to get help migrating the data.
:::

::: {.instructions}
Do these checks on the file.
:::


#### Data checks

- Are the metadata on the "Info" sheet still (correctly) filled?^[90% of export problems come from badly filled metadata]
- Do patients have IDs?
- Are there replicated IDs?
- Check the filters of a couple of date columns: do the dates correspond to what you expect (min, max) and are there values not recognised as dates?
- Check a couple of categorical columns (`sex`, `outcome`...) to see if the categories entered correspond to the expected values.
- Remove any filters applied on the data (there is a shortcut for that in the OBT menu).


### Analyses

Now let's investigate the descriptive analyses provided with the linelist. While the interface of the linelist is the same, the provided analyses may differ a bit from disease to disease, depending on what was requested, and what is encoded in the **setup file**^[Note that more analyses can be requested if needed]. Most linelists have at least the uni and bivariate tables, the temporal and spatial analyses.


There are a couple of important things about the analyses:

1. The most important thing to remember about analyses in the OBT linelist is that they need to be **refreshed** before being explored.

![Refresh button in the OBT menu](../module_1/images/004-refresh.png){fig-align="center"}

2. The second most important thing to know is that if you filter data in the main patient sheet, it will be reflected in the analyses *after you refresh* (a red warning will appear to remind you).

3. You can alter the appearance of the graphs (which are created automatically and admittedly a bit ugly), the same way you would do for your own figures, with any [Excel tool](https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-format-your-chart-in-excel/).^[Note that graphs modifications will be lost during data migration to a new version of the linelist, so I advise you to restrict the modifications to graphs that you want to export to reports / slides, or which are _really_ making your eyes bleed.]

We are going to start by looking at the analyses without filters on the data.

::: {.instructions}
Go to the patient data sheet, navigate to the OBT menu and click on the button to clear all filters. Then refresh analyses.
:::

Now that the data was refreshed, we can begin checking out the analyses sheets.

### Persons: uni and bivariate analyses

This page contains univariate and bivariate tables and bar charts providing information about patients: demographic informations, but also symptoms, outcomes etc.

::: {.instructions}
Explore the page, and answer the following questions:

- What is the average length of stay of the patients?
- How many patients are more than 15 years old?
- How many patients are female?
- What is the percentage of complicated measles?
- How many patients are SAM?
- How many patients died in the facility?
- How many patients are male and less than 5 months old?
- How many of the SAM patients are positive for the malaria RDT test?
:::

Now let us investigate the characteristics of deceased patients.

::: {.instructions}
1. Go back to the patient data sheet. Use the filters to select only the deceased patients (in the facility and/or the community, it's up to you)
2. Hit the refresh button and go back to the analysis sheet.

- How many female patients of age between one and four died?
- How many of the deceased patients were MAM?
:::



### Time: temporal analyses

Now, let's look at the "Temporal analyses" sheet. On this sheet you can choose the temporal scale you want to monitor: days, weeks, months, quarter, years. The table has 53 rows, and can thus accommodate up to:

- a high resolution zoom of a given period of 53 days
- one year worth of weeks
- 53 months if you have several years worth of data
- 53 quarters or years (but we do not expect you to often use these scales)

![Options for the temporal analyses](../module_1/images/007-img-temporal-table.png){fig-align="center"}

Below the tables are several epicurves corresponding to the content of the table.

::: {.callout-note}
In this linelist, there is only one very large table. Some other linelists can have several tables, organised by sections, on top of each others. The graphs will always be a the bottom.
:::

::: {.instructions}
- Remove the filters on the data sheet and hit refresh.
- Check the minimum and maximum date of notification: which units would you consider?
- First select the "Week" unit. Which part of the data is not ploted?
- How many patients were discharged during the 18th week of 2022?
- Now change the date of start of period to only plot the weeks of 2023.
- How many patients were hospitalised in the second week of January 2023?
- Change the units to "Month". How many patients were admitted in January 2023?
:::

Now, if you went to have a look at the graphs, you should see one like that in the list of graphs:

![Hospitalisations](../module_1/images/008-img-temporal-hospit_raw.png){fig-align="center"}

It is fine to look at the shape of the epicurve, but you would not want to use it in a report as it is. Beside cosmetic improvement, you can use filters to remove the empty weeks at the right of the graph:

- Select the graph -> some buttons appear at the top right corner.
- Use the "filter" button (the bottom one) to filter out the categories you don't want to see.

![Minimally pimped graph](../module_1/images/009-img-temporal-hospit_pimped.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-warning}
Don't forget to remove the graph filters when new data is entered in the linelist, else you won't see it on the graph. The corrolary is that if your colleague sends you a linelist complaining that the figures are correct in the table but do not appear in the graph, the filters are the prime suspects.
:::

### Place: spatial analyses

Now we navigate to the third analyses sheet. It displays the **top 30 areas** with the most cases, and below the top 30 places of origin (in the case of refugees and displaced people).^[The number 30 is defined in the **setup file**: another disease might have 10 or 20.]

You can select the level at which you want to see the data displayed (admin 1 to 4).

::: {.instructions}
Click on the blue button "Select your admin level" and go through the options. Which options have data in it? How many patients are there in Moissala Est?
:::

For this linelist, data is meaningful at the "Zone of responsibility" level (admin 3), but with real data even higher levers may be worth checking if people are travelling a lot, or if you created a master linelist from different files.


### Place and person: spatio-temporal analyses

The last analysis sheet that may be in an OBT linelist is a crossover between the temporal analysis and the spatial analysis: it allow you to look at the number of cases (usually) for a couple of chosen administrative levels across time.


::: {.instructions}
1. Go to the Spatio-temporal analysis sheet
2. Place your cursor in one of the blue cells on the left (starting from `C14` and down).
3. Click on the ["GeoHelper"](../how_to/use_geohelper.qmd) button in the OBT menu and select Moissala Est (an admin 3)
4. Go to the next blue cell and use the Geohelper to select another place of interest (for example, one of the top places from the Spatial analysis sheet, or a place that you noticed had recent cases).
:::


![Spatio temporal analysis](../module_1/images/010-img-spatio-temporal.png){fig-align="center"}



## Part 3: Troubleshooting

### ðŸ§­ Context

You have sent a linelist for deployment to the field. The data encoder may have some questions or problems.

For the following problem, identify the source of the problem and the solution.


### Opening the file and getting it to work

**Problem**: your colleague opens the file


The user tells you that the file is broken and that they cannot open it


### General file management

Often people do not read the documentation, do not know the existence of the [OBT menu](../reference/ribbons.qmd#sec-linelist-ribbon), or know it be never checked it out. A lot of the requests you might get derive from this and the good news is that they are pretty straightforward to solve.


#### No more rows!

You receive the following mail:

> Hello, attached is a linelist that is giving us trouble. Some cells are locked, so we cannot add new cases. We can't work, please help.

What do you answer?

::: {.callout-tip title="Answer" collapse=true style="width:300px"}
Use the "Add rows" button from the OBT menu to add lines at the bottom of the file.

**Note**: recent versions of the linelist automaticcaly add five lines at the bottom of the file when someone enters data in the last line, so this should be less common that what it used to be. If this happens to you check whether there is a more recent version of the linelist to use!
:::


#### Remove empty rows

You receive the following email:

> Hi, I need support on the linelist. There are empty lines (colored in red) and I can't remove them because the file is protected, help please.

What do you answer?

::: {.callout-tip title="Answer"  collapse=true}
Use the "Resize table" button from the OBT menu.
:::

#### Missing rows

You get this mail:

> Good evening, we entered data but some rows seem to be missing now but we did not delete them.

This one is trickier, because this could be caused by several problems, including unsaved documents (data from "yesterday" or "this morning") and synchronisation errors (the last file got replaced by an older version from the server). Since the sheet is protected, it is hard to delete data in bulk though.

Your best hope is that there is a filter applied somewhere on the data and the rows are merely hidden. You can solve this problem in one click though. Which button would you use?

#### Analyses not up-to-date

You receive the following email:

> Good morning, I added data to the file but the analyses are empty / not to date.

What do you answer?

::: {.callout-tip title="Answer"  collapse=true}
Use the "Refresh analyses" button from the OBT menu
:::

Addendum from January 2025:

The day after they contact you again:

> Good morning, I used the refresh button yesterday to update the analyses and it woked. But today I entered new data, refreshed but all the data on the analyses sheets are striken. I cannot remove the strikethrough and I did not do anything, just enter data.

A recent update in Excel 365 uses [strikethrough](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/stale-value-formatting-4b5c63c3-5dc7-4e9b-8e24-88bed1987dbd) to label what Excel considers "stale values" (values that depend on other cells, which were modified). For some obscure reason, the "Refresh analyses" does not trigger the removal of the strikethrough (despite recalculating the ranges). A fix in the OBT is coming from 2025, but meanwhile, if it happens:

- Hit the F9 shortcut to force recalculation (or use the "Calculate now" button from the "Formula" Exce native menu)
- Then hit the "Refresh analyses" button

Alternately, you can [turn off](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/stale-value-formatting-4b5c63c3-5dc7-4e9b-8e24-88bed1987dbd) this option if it bothers you in your files in general.^[Maybe you use VBA in your own files and are bothered that Range.Calculate does _not_ remove the strikethrough, just Sheet.Caluclate or Application.Caclulate.]


#### Sending the data to the dashboard

Another source of friction is the sharing step of the linelist. In all cases, it is good to brief them again on the [steps](../how_to/export_data_dashboard.qmd) to send data to the dashboard, but see if you can find the exact problems with the files sent below.

- They send the file `measles_linelist_moissala.xlsb` to <EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org> and received an error

- They used OneDrive to share the linelist with <EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org> and received an error

- They sent `measles_linelist_moissala_export_data_20250203-1136.xlsx` to <EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org> and received an error

- They sent `MSL_linelist__MSL24__info_country_code__info_organisation__info_facility_name__anonymous__vb-1003__20250103-1541` to <EPI-DATA@epicentre.msf.org> and probably did not receive an error, but the data does not appear in Chad in the dashboard


::: {.callout-tip collapse=true title="Tip"}
The file to send should be named `MSL_linelist__MSL24__TCD__MSF-OCP__Mandoul Hospital__anonymous__vb-1003__20250103-1541`
:::


::: {.callout-tip collapse=true title="Answers"}
Either they sent the linelist itself, the wrong export, or the good xport but they did not fill the "Info" sheet so the metadata could not be used in the name
:::


In the following steps



#### Other TODO

- Calculated columns not calculating: use the F9 button to force recalculation
- A place is not appeasing on the dashboard on the map -> not matched

### Advanced

Sometimes the problem is less obvious or could have multiple causes, and you will need to investigate a bit more.

::: {.instructions}
Open the Excel file `troubleshooting.xlsb` from the tutorial material archive.
:::

You colleague contacts you. They have data for the start of January 2023, and they looked at the analyses sheets. But the analyses seem broken, even though they refreshed the data.

**Problem 1.** They _know_ they have positive measles cases, but these cases do not show up in the univariate table / graph about Measle test results.

**Problem 2.** The register says there should be 25 notifications in the first week, and 40 in the second week, but the numbers in the epicurve do not match. The univariate general summary is correct, though (65 patients seen).

***Problem 3.** They know there should be 5 deceased patients in facilities, 3 who had been notified in week 1, and 2 notified in week 2. But the numbers in the temporal analysis do not correspond.


::: {.instructions}
Figure out what the problems are. If the problems are quick to fix, do it. Think about the guidance you should provide your colleagues with to avoid these problems or troubleshoot them themselves.
:::


::: {.callout-note title="Hints collapse=true}
**Problem 1.** Check out the authorised and entered values for the incriminated column. Looking at the values in the filter is the fastest way to do so.

**Problem 2.** The temporal analyses rely on dates, by definition.

**Problem 3.** There are several sources to this problem. Maybe one less depending on what you did for in past steps.
:::


::: {.callout-note title="More hints collapse=true}
**Problem 3.** Are the dates correct? Are the values of the column correct? 



If yes, what else could affect a graph based on epiweeks?
:::


::: {.callout-note title="Wink Wink Nudge Nudge collapse=true}
**Problem 3.** Maybe go check @sec-customise to see if there is an option you should check.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Answers" collapse=true}
**Problem 1.** They did not use the dropdown menu in the lab result column and somehow forced a value not from the list ("Pos" instead of "Positive")

**Problem 2.** The notification date has some very dirty values that were not recognised as dates. As such, these notifications cannot be counted in the _temporal_ analyses, because the conditions on the date cannot be met. Since the univariate summary has no conditions on dates, it is not affected.

**Problem 3.** One of the notification date was dirty and not recognised as a date. But maybe that was solved during the second problem if you felt confident about the dates. One of the values of the outcome column had a typo. Finally, the start of the week somehow got changed to Sunday, while it should be Monday in Chad, and one of the row was affected by that. have a look at the epiweek column, change the start of the week and check the column again (recalculate if needed).
:::

The last problem is tricky, but it could happen easilly in a country where the start of the week is not the same as the default (Monday) and someone forgot to change it before using the file.


## Part 4: Dashboard

### ðŸ§­ Context

The linelist is in use, and it was decided that the data would be sent for compilation and visualisation to Epicentre. You want to go and monitor the number of cases in Moissala.

### Access the dashboard

You need an account to connect to Epicentre dashboard. The creation of this account is semi-automatic for MSF addresses: go to [this page](https://reports.msf.net/signup/).^[If you do not have an MSF address but think you should have access to a dashboard, contact the EpiDS team.]

Once you have an account, you can go to the intersection dashboard [site](https://apps.epicentre-msf.org/secure/app/intersectional-surveillance) and connect with the account you created.

### Sidebar filters

On the left (number 1 on @fig-dashboard) you have the option sidebar, where you can filter data  (diseases, OC, country, site, outcome etc.) and customise a couple of options.

::: {.instructions}
- Pick "Measles" from the filter
- Find the country filter and select "Chad"
- Click on the "Update" button at the bottom to take into account your filters!
:::

The dashboard now only displays measles data in Chad.

![Dashboard](../module_1/images/012-img-dashboard.png){fig-align="center" #fig-dashboard}

### Map

First let's look at the map.

::: {.instructions}
- Zoom on the map to better see what's happening in Chad.
- Select the ADM1 level to get a better resolution. Which health region has the most cases?
- Select the ADM2 level to see even more precisely. Which health district has the most cases? How many patients do not have (matched) geo data at this level (hint: there is a message at the bottom of the map)?
- Select the ADM3 level to see if we have enough data at that level? What do you think?
:::

The top of the map displays an "options" button that allow you to tweak circle size to reduce overlap and group data by a couple of variables.

::: {.instructions}
Group data by whether patients are hospitalised or not. Do you see a difference between Moissala and Djodo Gassa?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
1. There is a button on the left of the map (number 3 on @fig-dashboard) that allows you to change the background of the map and hide / show the bubbles or attack rates to increase readability.

2. Click on a region to update the epicurve and age pyramid data for only the patients from this region. The selected region is highlighted in red. Click a second time on it to unselect it.
:::


### Epicurve

The top-right figure displays an epicurve. By default it looks like this for Chad:

![Default epicurve](../module_1/images/013-img-epicurve.png){fig-align="center" #fig-dashboard}

::: {.instructions}
Use the options of the graph (number 4 on @fig-dashboard) to modify it to look like this:  

![Admissions in hospital across time](../module_1/images/014-img-epicurve-2.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
1. The map and the epicurve have a hidden zoom button that you can see by hovering your mouse at the bottom right, which is handy on small screens (see number 5 on @fig-dashboard) .
