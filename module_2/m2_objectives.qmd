This module teaches how to generate an OBT linelist from a dictionary using the OutbreakTools toolkit
You will then learn how to modify a setup to perform common tasks, such as adding a specific export of data for a MoH, and adding some analyses that you need.

**Tentative length: 3h**

## Objectives

After this training, you will be able to:

-	Find the most recent version of the tools, as well as the documentation
-	Describe the functions of the different **setup file** sheets
-	Modify an existing **setup file** to:

    - Add new categorical and calculated variables
    - Add a new export
    - Add new analyses
-	Use this **setup** and the **designer** to generate a new linelist

## Prerequistes

You should have completed the first module on [OutbreakTools linelists](../module_1/m1_objectives.qmd), or be very familiar with the OBT linelists and their functions (optional variables, custom dropdown, analysesâ€¦)

## Content of the training

The training is based on an explicative document, and a self-paced tutorial. The tutorial is based on three situations that you are likely to encounter:

- Adding extra variables
- Creating a country specific export to make the MoH happy
- Add a new table or graph to the analyses sheets
